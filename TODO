t
have a dashboard for accountant who will have access to budget remaining and lets have a approve button which will change the status to approved

once the project is approved, he can switch to the exp tab and the approved projects will be available and once in the expenditure if we select the system and make the transaction, we will have the status of the system turned into "CONSTRUCTED"\

Donate button should be there on the home page

Need to write Donations route to avail Accountant see all donations. Need to add budget remaining button

What is the project manager doing?
we planned that he will approve projects. but how? can he see the budget remaining?

Who is recording the Water Usage?
